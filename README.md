# WHIP Mobility Coding Test

## Assignment

Create a calendar application using Angular and State manager

### Features

- Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 50 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also, include a city.
- Display reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order.
- Allow the user to select color when creating a reminder and display it appropriately.
- Ability to edit reminders - including changing text, city, day, time and color.
- Add a weather service call from a free API, and get the weather forecast (ex. Rain) for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city.
- Unit test the functionality: Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 50 chars) for a user
  entered day and time. Also, include a city.
- Functionality to delete one reminder for a specific day

### Bonus (Optional)

- Expand the calendar to support more than the current month.
- Properly handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.
- Functionality to delete ALL the reminders for a specific day
- Autocomplete feature for cities input
- Styles to Weather section
- Unit tests for every component

### Considerations

- NgRx (or any other state manager) structure of the calendar
- The project is totally focused on the front-end; please ignore the back-end.
- Keep your code versioned with Git
- Feel free to use small helper libraries for:
  - UI Elements.
  - Date/Time handling.
- **You must create the calendar component yourself. Do not use calendar libraries like FullCalendar or Bootstrap Calendar**
- If you use an external API, make sure to provide working API keys.

### Evaluation Criteria

- TypeScript best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### Deliverables
Make sure to include all source code in the repository.

### Submit
Please organize, design, test, deploy and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes codes to a new branch. After you have pushed your code.
